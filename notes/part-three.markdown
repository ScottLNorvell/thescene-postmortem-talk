### When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail

Our hammer was Javascript with a healthy mix of Ruby, and Ember was the jackhammer.
We wrote Mixins, when we should have written Service & Initializers. We deeply
nested Views when we should have build application-specific components. We believed
all parts of the view were equally important, whether they were visible or not.
We weren't leveraging our Handlebar templates to prevent loading of content and
to load it after certain conditions were met.
